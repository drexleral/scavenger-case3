## Founder of computer science, mathematician, philosopher, codebreaker, strange visionary

**Alan Turing**, in full **Alan Mathison Turing**, (born June 23, 1912, London, Englandâ€”died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.

Alan Turing was convicted with gross indecency, British law in a statute of the British Parliament in 1885 and was carried forward in other statutes throughout the British Empire. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.

In commemoration of Alan works as codebreaker, decypher this encrypted message:

The key in breaking the encrypted message starting 1 then increment by 1 to Enigma. And the cipher method is used by Giovan Battista Bellaso, which unfortunately was credited to someone else.


During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.
